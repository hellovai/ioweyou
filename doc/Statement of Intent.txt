	We developed Cloud Source to serve as a unique solution to the common dilemmas experienced by students throughout the campus. 
It is in the interest of facilitating increased student interactions both within and outside of the classroom environment that we introduce our innovation. 
We believe that the greatest academic treasure in a classroom, aside from the knowledge of the professor, is the collective resources of the students. 
The focal premise of Cloud Source is to expedite student communication - to this end, we offer services such as the LinkMe program, Q&A boards, and 
Document Vaults. We trust that, armed with the advantage of Cloud Source, student users will find themselves with direct access to a treasure trove of shared knowledge. 

By the end of November, the beta version of Cloud Source will be complete and released to a discrete number of individuals and majors within
the University of Texas campus. After obtaining their feedback and modifying the website as needed, Cloud Source will be released to two more colleges within UT,
and another evaluation will take place. It is our hope that by the beginning of the Fall 2013 semester, Cloud Source will be available to all University of Texas students. 
We ultimately hope to expand to college campuses across the nation and provide our services to a diverse number of universities. The success of Cloud Source
 will be evaluated through a multiple of avenues, including polling, surveys, traffic volume of the website, and the retention rate of our users. After applying the
necessary modifications, our vision is for the service to become a tool utilized by students across an array of campuses to raise both social and academic performance 
and efficiency.
